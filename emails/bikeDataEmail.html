	Hello MEMBER_NAME!
    <p/>
	This year brings a new policy and procedure to our membership. Throughout the years the club has dealt with many ways to recognize, identify and confirm its members. 
	For the 2020 season we will be issuing and enforcing the use of club member identification fork stickers. This will allow us to protect the club in many ways and 
	help identify our members. 
	<p/>
	We will be requiring all of our members to fill out the form linked below. Once we receive this information you will be sent a sticker or stickers 
	for each of your motorcycles. Those stickers will shall be placed on the LEFT FORK BETWEEN THE TRIPLE CLAMPS FACING OUTWARD. NO EXCEPTIONS!
    <p/>
    Please use your link below to access your custom form.  Note that this one form is only for you - we prefill your information using this link so it will only
	work for you.
	<p/>
	Note that your form also will show your mailing address and phone number that we have on file.  Please make sure this is correct as this is where we will mail
	your stickers.  This is especially important for long time members.  We have not used these addresses in some time for many of you, and they may be out of date as 
	a result.
    <p/>
